# ui_io
For writing text to serial etc.

Mainly just some #defines

The idea was to use this for debugging and menu's on a small lcd or 4 line text LCD etc. but never got very far. I would not of made this public but it is used in my other public stuff and on the off chance anyone ever uses any of that they might want this.

There is also code to print out colours on the console or terminal to help with debugging or setup. Although the Arduino IDEs built in serial monitors don't support colours. VsCode or just a standard bash terminal do, at least on my computer.
